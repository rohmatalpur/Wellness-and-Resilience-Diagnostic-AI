2,402.718,403.098,Ellie,mhm
2,403.148,409.858,Participant,it's sometimes hard to find someone who's gonna be uplifting or try to be inspiring so
2,410.938,416.708,Participant,i don't really have anybody in particular but people have kind of brought up things here and there
2,418.748,419.318,Ellie,like what
2,420.078,436.018,Participant,you know just like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or hey you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that just you know i'm always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe i might i could do differently
2,436.528,443.208,Participant,instead of just being negative saying hey don't do that that's no that's why are you doing that it's a waste of time
2,444.388,444.738,Ellie,mmm

2,448.588,450.428,Ellie,how are you at controlling your temper

2,473.298,484.118,Participant,well back to the point about people provoking me so i mean i try not to blow steam and let them get under my skin so i just usually try not to let it get to me
2,484.988,489.698,Participant,but i don't know i guess with temper i guess it depends on how i handle my stress
2,490.438,495.248,Participant,lately i've been better at it just because i think my situation's been a little bit better
2,497.098,497.688,Ellie,that's good

2,520.658,521.578,Participant,nothing major
2,522.448,533.018,Participant,i mean maybe when i was younger i could've traveled more or i could've worked towards something that paid better job-wise but i mean
2,533.708,540.138,Participant,those are all things that i think at any point in life you always think like well i coulda shoulda would've done but you know
2,541.278,552.838,Participant,but then again i think that's natural for anybody i mean i could i could've become a banker or i could've become a lawyer or a doctor and made about ten times the money that i make now but
2,553.538,559.818,Participant,but then again i don't like the law and i don't like medicine so so i'm it wasn't meant to be so
2,560.518,560.828,Ellie,right
2,561.808,563.778,Ellie,there are always trade offs in life aren't there
2,563.948,564.398,Participant,yeah

2,571.488,573.608,Participant,in my life i knew that
2,574.368,590.858,Participant,i there's a lot of things i have <ha> there's more dislikes <laughter> than likes so i kinda narrowed it down to what am i good at and what am i not good at and what am i gonna work well or who who am i gonna work well with and who will i not work well with
2,591.348,595.318,Participant,so i kind of i kinda sorted out and then the list kind of
2,596.498,598.648,Participant,mmm kind of answered itself so
2,599.658,600.998,Ellie,that sounds really hard
2,602.078,616.388,Participant,no it i don't think it was hard but it was just but i think it was a real reality check and i think it it's kind of a good thing 'cause sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense
2,616.738,631.878,Participant,it's like trying to shove a a round peg into a square a square hole and it's like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not gonna go in so sometimes it's just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you
2,633.018,633.288,Ellie,right
2,633.918,634.848,Ellie,that makes sense

2,667.058,679.768,Participant,i got a job and i can i can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person it it sounds stupid but you know i think just the fact that i'm able
2,680.588,688.298,Participant,i'm able to get this far in life without like completely self-destructing is already an accomplishment so i feel like
2,689.468,690.498,Participant,i've gotten somewhere
2,691.578,692.328,Ellie,that's great

8,381.08,382.77,Participant,and so and
8,383.22,389.81,Participant,so by doing that what he does is he orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not being healthy
8,390.06,401.69,Participant,and so i got frustrated with him 'cause i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and each time he's like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it so he's constantly breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry is people that don't follow through
8,390.24,391.63,Ellie,[laughter]
8,402.14,402.94,Ellie,yeah

8,466.847,468.307,Participant,i like to see
8,469.442,491.958,Participant,the result from all my hard work 'cause i majored in sociology and as much as i loved that major is you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution so it's just like at the end all you have is just these theoretical elements that you can't really do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so
8,480.566,481.076,Ellie,mhm

8,592.552,601.059,Participant,one of the trips that i took with my family i was a three week roadtrip with my family there's five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon
8,600.517,601.487,Ellie,oh my gosh
8,601.477,612.473,Participant,i know needless to say it's like when you're that close proximity for three weeks camping you start getting on each others' nerves but it was really fun and like even though i've traveled so many places
8,612.755,625.621,Participant,i realized that there's like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty so
8,626.059,626.699,Participant,um
8,627.139,637.448,Participant,and we saw a grizzly bear black bear lots of bison a wolf and it was really cool those kinds of i don't know natural wonders also really amaze me 'cause those things aren't man made
8,637.791,645.129,Participant,and as as pretentious as it sounds after a while europe kinda gets not old but it's like you know you get the same idea like
8,645.913,654.185,Participant,white old white men building great buildings and art work and it's beautiful and all but like you just kind of like okay i wanna see something that's natural and beautiful
8,654.34,655.94,Participant,or something that's different too
8,656.232,657.122,Ellie,yeah
8,657.246,658.206,Ellie,i see what you mean
8,661.116,661.896,Participant,cool
8,661.903,664.033,Ellie,how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
8,665.498,666.538,Participant,um
8,668.048,670.124,Participant,pretty easy as long as I
8,672.057,674.689,Participant,get well no i always sleep so easy
8,675.566,677.486,Ellie,what are you like when you don't sleep well
8,678.375,688.813,Participant,oh grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don't say much and just kinda off in my own world
8,689.66,691.21,Ellie,do you feel that way often
8,691.875,698.066,Participant,i not not anymore i usually get enough sleep and i've been working out more so it's kind of 
8,698.424,701.344,Participant,energizing me so no it's not too bad
8,701.79,702.7,Participant,that's good
8,703.555,706.965,Ellie,have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
8,709.758,722.85,Participant,uh i guess i've just been more negative but it has to do with like circumstances kind of like uh it's been about five months since i quit my full time job haven't found anything else haven't really found anything else i'm interested in
8,723.416,724.266,Participant,so
8,725.739,730.384,Participant,it's more of just like ugh what am i doing da da da that kind of thing
8,730.375,730.985,Ellie,yeah
8,731.474,733.744,Ellie,it can be tough to find a good job these days
8,733.861,749.684,Participant,yeah it's it is hard the market and just like i'm very picky 'cause i don't wanna just sittin in a little my own cubicle 'cause i quit my job exactly for that reason so why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job for
8,743.769,744.359,Ellie,mhm
8,749.98,761.131,Participant,so it's just like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so it's just kinda like i'm stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck
8,761.508,766.426,Participant,barely making it and just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like
8,767.282,774.782,Participant,when do i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles i don't know
8,774.85,776.41,Ellie,that sounds really hard
8,776.759,782.55,Participant,yeah it is hard but i mean i guess everyone goes through that same situation after college so
8,782.906,800.323,Participant,but i guess it's tough 'cause a lot of my friends 'cause i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a friend who's teaching english in afghanistan and i have another one who's met the president you know and one that's doing teach for america another friend who's in harvard uh school for like harvard masters [mass] you know getting her masters so it's kind of like ahh
8,801.222,805.167,Participant,all that comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so
8,806.5,807.03,Ellie,yeah
8,808.36,809.49,Ellie,do you feel down
8,810.629,817.036,Participant,uh i do sometimes yes but i'm going to hawaii next week so right now i'm fine [laughter]
8,816.911,817.531,Ellie,nice
8,818.194,818.684,Participant,yes
8,819.293,822.278,Participant,but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because
8,822.278,824.318,Participant,i'm just trying to find like what
8,824.954,841.311,Participant,i'm supposed to like you know what do i want to do next and like money situations which is very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like it's just groceries like i can't even afford groceries
8,841.522,852.068,Participant,so it's just hard to like live this way especially after you've paid so much money for like an amazing college education so it's a little bit frustrating but there's a lot of people in the same situation
8,852.239,853.139,Ellie,yeah
8,853.319,854.259,Ellie,i'm sorry
8,854.589,855.489,Participant,it's all good
8,856.02,858.08,Ellie,have you been diagnosed with depression
8,859.168,862.419,Participant,uh no i don't think so but i mean
8,862.742,866.134,Participant,i think everyone goes through depression here and there so i don't know if you can
8,866.374,870.159,Participant,but not like medically diagnose i'm not on meds

8,885.505,886.855,Participant,oh let's see
8,887.114,892.455,Participant,uh to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail
8,893.177,901.414,Participant,'cause i'm one of those people if i'm not gonna be the best at something then i'm just not gonna try i accept the best or nothing at all go big or go home
8,901.93,909.236,Participant,so but i think i would've told my high school self that go and try lots of things even if it means i'm not gonna be the best at it
8,909.938,910.488,Participant,so
8,910.893,912.143,Participant,ten years ago
8,911.193,912.003,Ellie,like what
8,912.839,915.181,Participant,well that would've made me like twelve so
8,916.69,921.14,Participant, [laughter] um i used to do a lot of things i i used to act

8,932.115,936.379,Participant,and i kind of stopped doing those things 'cause it's like oh i'm not good at it so i'm not gonna do it
8,936.639,941.599,Participant,and i think if i just continued doing those things and tried you know different classes 
8,942.396,948.93,Participant,um i don't know different sports i kinda just stuck with soccer growing up i don't know just
8,949.25,956.18,Participant,expand myself more rather than like find something i'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder
8,956.526,961.406,Participant,kinda just like stay i always kinda stayed at one level but once i'm good i just stay for good
8,961.683,963.683,Participant,i don't try to go above that
8,964.111,965.411,Participant,if that makes any sense

8,984.896,996.477,Participant,or bake but now it's just like since i'm on my feet all day and like constantly interacting with people i just kinda wanna unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and being like i'm done
8,997.68,998.06,Participant,so

13,490.37,497.08,Participant,you read about einstein and things like that it's he's this general xxx hero particle physics and you have no idea what it is and you know it's very complicated things like quantum mechanics
13,497.78,498.27,Participant,and
13,498.85,502.37,Participant,you still haven't realized you're interested in that and but you're not sure if you can actually make it

15,1276.525,1280.025,Participant,sense of joy excitement relief
15,1280.24,1282.02,Participant,because of course you're out of the pain
15,1282.715,1286.81,Participant,and then like it's just it's just a matter of you know
15,1287.11,1288.75,Participant,going forward from there but it's
15,1289.595,1293.715,Participant,it's like something you can't explain it's it's just it's awesome
15,1294.315,1295.495,Participant,after you give birth
15,1297.13,1299.12,Ellie,that sounds like a great situation
15,1297.19,1300.125,Participant,and i have experienced both ways i've done both um
15,1300.632,1301.642,Participant,natural and

15,1315.157,1316.197,Participant,um
15,1318.892,1322.432,Participant,i with my third child i had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little
15,1323.047,1327.397,Participant,psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when i was in labor it wasn't funny
15,1328.087,1329.007,Ellie,[laughter]
15,1328.092,1329.892,Participant,and um she
15,1330.757,1335.402,Participant,she was not there when the doctor i mean it was my my third child was
15,1336.242,1339.642,Participant,born very quickly after he broke the water and oof
15,1340.277,1343.787,Participant,my husband was there but she was not nor was the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble
15,1344.547,1346.977,Participant,because i only had like two contractions after that
15,1347.087,1348.067,Ellie,oh no
15,1347.352,1348.802,Participant,my daughter was born in the bed
15,1349.602,1352.672,Participant,so for me it was great 'cause i didn't have to go through any of the labor but
15,1353.522,1355.502,Participant,um i'm sure they weren't happy
15,1355.727,1357.597,Participant,to fill out a lot of paper work after that
15,1358.677,1359.127,Ellie,yeah
15,1358.677,1359.127,Participant,so
15,1360.987,1364.027,Ellie,what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
15,1366.802,1369.512,Participant,now would i give mysef for ten or twenty years ago
15,1370.782,1371.682,Participant,um
15,1375.517,1377.827,Participant,ten or twenty years ago i was probably more
15,1378.517,1379.667,Participant,not as um
15,1380.127,1382.367,Participant,relaxed not as um
15,1383.782,1386.672,Participant,like i feel now at my age that um
15,1389.262,1393.732,Participant,i i don't have the same concerns that i did then i don't worry about
15,1394.342,1398.672,Participant,uh i don't worry at all about what people think about me i don't worry at all about what
15,1399.042,1399.622,Participant,you know
15,1400.057,1405.752,Participant,you know like my i noticed my daughter's oh mom you can't wear that because people are gonna say this i just say i don't care
15,1406.287,1412.322,Participant,you know but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that that oh mom you have to dress like this and dress like that whatever
15,1412.844,1417.129,Participant,so that would probably be it the wisdom that you you achieve with age that
15,1417.639,1422.404,Participant,you you see how life there are so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things
15,1423.384,1424.234,Ellie,that makes sense
15,1426.824,1428.614,Participant,what are you most proud of in your life

15,1446.179,1450.954,Participant,their friends suffer who come from divorced families or single parents and
15,1451.644,1452.744,Participant,they um
15,1453.079,1454.669,Participant,they actually express
15,1455.069,1459.844,Participant,gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family
15,1460.374,1462.314,Participant,so i would say that's probably it
15,1462.909,1463.949,Ellie,that's great

38,176.14,176.52,Ellie,why
38,177.5,182.09,Participant,because i find that performing more is more interesting i like being talent more than i like being crew <laughter>
38,183.31,189.76,Participant,so i kinda wanna get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what i wanna do with my life
38,190.73,191.2,Ellie,okay

38,313.63,315.84,Participant,and i like to travel more um
38,317.15,323.04,Participant,i would love to travel for work things or whatever but i don't get as much of an opportunity as i would like to to travel
38,324.42,325.9,Ellie,what do you enjoy about traveling
38,327.27,336.58,Participant,seeing <see> uh particularly traveling by car seeing like the landscape change seeing people change seeing you know feeling the vibrations of the area change 
38,337.33,342.97,Participant,i like just seeing what's out there seeing and i know that there's a bigger world outside of 
38,344.05,347.58,Participant,where i am and where i live and my world and i like to see that
38,348.85,349.16,Ellie,uh huh
38,349.08,351.64,Participant,but i like to leave that too and go back to my own world <laughter>
38,352.34,353.03,Ellie,<laughter>
38,353.08,353.87,Participant,<laughter> <clears throat>
38,354.46,356.03,Ellie,i'd love to hear about one of your trips
38,357.94,358.91,Participant,um
38,359.77,360.22,Participant,let's see
38,361.19,369.65,Participant,xxx a trip that i like to take is to make the drive from here to nevada whether i go all the way to vegas or just go to state line
38,371.18,374.2,Participant,um my cousin and i would take what we call
38,375.12,383.43,Participant,exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway so we'd take those we'd just  
38,384.38,388.19,Participant,sort of impromptu with like <li> a day or two notice just move things around just take off
38,388.81,395.14,Participant,so those are actually trips that i i like making <mak> 'cause i take off and then just come back sometimes the same day sometimes overnight
38,395.99,398.21,Participant,just small short trips that
38,399.36,403.31,Participant,aren't very involved but you just get to go and you see things and see how
38,403.95,412.37,Participant,um you know the desert landscape looks in different seasons how people react in different times of the year in different areas 
38,411.71,412.01,Ellie,uh huh
38,413.16,414.65,Participant,so close to home but not
38,415.95,424.35,Participant,but not close to home close to home but uh still a world away so that 'cause i don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever but that's just little things that
38,425.14,434.98,Participant,kinda put things back in perspective and and clear my head and things like that i mean 'cause there's sort of a sense of meditation and zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway
38,435.48,435.86,Ellie,yeah
38,435.9,438.6,Participant,so i i like i like doing that
38,436.23,437.22,Ellie,i see what you mean
38,439.84,440.11,Ellie,cool
38,440.91,442.46,Ellie,when was the last time that happened
38,443.94,449.91,Participant,the last time that happened was may of last year that's the last time i was able to do that
38,450.64,455.45,Participant,we actually my aunt came over with my cousin who's ten years younger than i am
38,456.33,463.3,Participant,and we kinda grew up like sisters and i was about to move away from the inland empire which is where they live
38,463.95,467.21,Participant,so they kinda took me on a last hurrah and we drove up to vegas
38,467.93,474.1,Participant,and looked around and came back 'cause i actually lived in vegas for awhile but i didn't like it so they kinda
38,474.9,477.94,Participant,i showed <show> showed them some of the locals sites around there
38,478.64,479.7,Participant,and we came back and was
38,480.47,480.89,Participant,you know
38,481.56,485.59,Participant,an overnight trip but we were driving the entire time <laughter> so
38,485.37,485.75,Ellie,wow
38,487.95,489.25,Participant,it was kind of an interesting
38,488.57,490.68,Ellie,what are some things that make you really mad
38,492.88,503.14,Participant,uh things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals people who can't fight back and they're mean to them just because they can't fight back  
38,504.25,504.9,Participant,and
38,506.14,506.85,Participant,i actually
38,508.24,509.71,Participant,like to see people who are
38,511.41,517.75,Participant,strong <st> as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate
38,518.36,518.7,Ellie,yeah
38,518.6,519.23,Participant,or what have you
38,520.58,524.79,Participant,so i think that's one thing that's makes me really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason
38,525.53,529.95,Participant,you know not people <pe> for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it
38,531.07,533.05,Participant,just that kinda really just makes me mad
38,531.52,531.82,Ellie,uh huh
38,534.72,535.15,Ellie,okay
38,535.69,537.15,Ellie,what do you do when you're annoyed
38,538.97,548.77,Participant,when i'm annoyed i'll try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me then i'll wind up lashing out somehow either  
38,549.89,551.08,Participant,you know verbally just
38,553.08,554.56,Participant,cutting 'em with a quip or
38,555.05,555.57,Participant,you know
38,556.08,559.01,Participant,i mean i i rarely just i rarely will yell at somebody
38,560.24,562.79,Participant,but i'll try to you know
38,563.66,571.44,Participant,if i'll try to walk away and defuse it if that doesn't work then i'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me <laughter> that usually works 
38,570.16,571.67,Ellie,has that gotten you in trouble
38,572.89,577.42,Participant,not in like legal trouble or anything because usually i'll find a way to
38,578.25,579.73,Participant,get them to leave me alone
38,580.97,581.45,Participant,um
38,586.16,594.63,Participant,so there's not really like big trouble but 'cause i think 'cause it's it it is off-putting and it's not expected <exp> the expected reaction
38,595.09,604.01,Participant,and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction 'cause i know that will work and get people away from me so it's not really in trouble and if 
38,595.34,595.69,Ellie,uh huh
38,604.98,607.26,Participant,it's is trouble it's usually trouble that
38,608.03,614.89,Participant,it's from their the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because it's usually a situation i can get out of 
38,615.95,619.86,Participant,so as long as they leave me alone you know i don't i i'll walk away from it
38,620.5,621.0,Ellie,okay
38,622.31,625.28,Ellie,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
38,626.71,629.18,Participant,uh the last time i argued with somebody
38,630.99,631.21,Participant,like
38,632.4,637.41,Participant,person <per> like a person <per> like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my
38,636.72,637.8,Ellie,whatever comes to your mind
38,639.07,641.64,Participant,uh the last thing i can think of was
38,643.23,643.76,Participant,i
38,644.43,649.33,Participant,argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law 'cause she's got dementia
38,650.11,657.47,Participant,and so we one of the reasons we came out here from the inland empire was to take care of her 'cause she won't go anywhere but l_a
38,658.07,663.78,Participant,i mean she is like hardcore angelino like you know we we know we are the we're that in our nature
38,664.55,670.92,Participant,but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere <laughter> but um so we came out here to take care of her 
38,667.67,668.04,Ellie,yeah
38,672.08,677.0,Participant,and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and i want her to move in with us
38,677.55,689.47,Participant,because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is 'cause she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process 
38,690.09,690.41,Ellie,yeah
38,690.45,697.4,Participant,but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what she wants 'cause he's a mama's boy like
38,697.9,705.24,Participant,i am i'm a mama's girl even though i've lost my mom like four years ago i'm still a mama's girl and i'll still <st> and i still and i know that
38,706.24,706.43,Participant,it
38,707.25,707.91,Participant,brings you
38,708.73,718.79,Participant,a sense of satisfaction to to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much and that's what they want so you wanna get it for 'em and because you know they you know that happened
38,719.32,723.61,Participant,when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it 
38,724.06,729.04,Participant,and you wanna do that for them now like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about somebody you feel deserves it
38,730.13,733.97,Participant,but it's kinda dangerous for her you know and i don't want things <thi> something to happen to her
38,734.55,742.79,Participant,yet i want her to remain who she is for as long as she can 'cause i know it the disease that she has is gonna erase who she is eventually
38,743.42,743.82,Ellie,yeah
38,743.42,751.05,Participant,and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her twenty four hour medically trained care
38,751.83,757.08,Participant,but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves 'cause it's not that bad
38,757.79,761.23,Participant,but it's getting where she really shouldn't <shou> has no business living by herself anymore
38,761.85,770.48,Participant,so the solution right now is he stays there most the time with her and i go back to our house and i it gets stressful and it gets annoying because i do
38,771.19,781.18,Participant,i handle the outside things i run the errands i take her to the store things like that he does the day to day things makes sure she has <ha> she eats makes sure she you know has clean clothes things like that
38,774.89,775.22,Ellie,uh huh
38,782.48,785.26,Participant,so i mean it's a partnership it's a it's
38,786.68,788.95,Participant,a dual effort it's very much a dual effort
38,789.81,793.2,Participant,but i would like her to move in with us so that was that's like
38,795.31,798.77,Participant,a source of it's not really like yelling screaming argument but
38,799.78,801.26,Participant,lively discussion <laughter>
38,801.72,803.05,Participant,you know than debate
38,802.06,802.48,Ellie,i see
38,804.62,805.99,Ellie,that sounds really hard
38,807.28,807.64,Participant,meh
38,808.98,812.76,Participant,it's not insurmountable i mean life's not gonna be easy ever
38,813.56,817.49,Participant,and if it is that's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you
38,818.06,821.34,Participant,so as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life it's not gonna be easy
38,822.06,824.69,Participant,but you deal with it and you you move on
38,825.7,826.08,Ellie,yeah
38,827.64,829.96,Ellie,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
38,831.04,834.66,Participant,uh the most positive influence i think have been probably my mother and my grandmother
38,835.27,840.47,Participant,'cause my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually
38,843.12,845.4,Participant,gave me a lot of confidence
38,846.13,848.56,Participant,and but were realistic about it
38,849.76,852.03,Participant,so i mean i think i have sort of a
38,853.08,862.89,Participant,realistic sort of a downer temperment <laughter> to myself but they but they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something i can't get over
38,863.67,863.99,Ellie,uh huh
38,863.74,871.37,Participant,and that you know life's gonna go on you know my mom would say to me when you're forty you're forty whether you're working at mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life
38,872.01,877.4,Participant,and i think that was a big influence on how i lived have how i've lived my life since she's passed  
38,878.96,879.74,Ellie,that's great
38,882.36,883.38,Ellie,is there anything you regret
38,886.04,892.7,Participant,i regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because i think it may have clouded some of my decisions
38,893.56,903.46,Participant,now i do have underlying conditions and everybody in my family is diabetic and i didn't take care of that when she was the last year of her life 'cause i was too busy wanting to get her home
38,904.14,905.71,Participant,my focus was to get her home
38,904.7,905.06,Ellie,yeah
38,906.66,916.48,Participant,so i didn't eat right i didn't take my insulin right um i wound up making myself insulin resistant that that year just 'cause my blood sugar was so high for eh like a year
38,916.95,920.19,Participant,eating just horrible foods when i did eat
38,920.94,923.94,Participant,so it really took a toll and i really actually made myself very sick 
38,924.67,926.83,Participant,and i'm wondering well if i didn't
38,927.4,934.78,Participant,if i would've taken care of myself and i had my head on completely straight and my my vision <vi> my vision and my thoughts weren't completely <complete> weren't clouded
38,935.96,939.64,Participant,would i have made some better decisions on her behalf especially when she needed 'em
38,940.4,944.07,Participant,and when she needed me to be to step in and make the decisions for her because she 
38,944.97,952.71,Participant,uh wound up having a health catastrophe 'cause she had kidney well she had kidney damage that wound up being kidney failure and
38,953.62,955.54,Participant,her health insurance provider missed that
38,956.34,957.57,Participant,so she wound up having
38,956.6,957.02,Ellie,wow
38,958.52,959.59,Participant,sort of this whole
38,961.08,964.31,Participant,catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down
38,965.04,969.95,Participant,she wound up having a stroke at like fifty one she had had a small stroke
38,970.71,978.03,Participant,and it just kinda went down from there so i'm thinking well if i didn't if i had taken care of better care of myself would i have been able to take better care of her
38,979.54,980.24,Participant,and i know
38,981.32,987.98,Participant,there wasn't anything i would've been able to do to prevent her death but what if i if i would i have been be able to make it easier on her
38,989.18,993.48,Participant,if i would have taken care of myself and that's like one huge regret that i have
38,994.28,994.63,Ellie,yeah
38,995.56,997.77,Ellie,do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself
38,998.7,1001.8,Participant,oh i know i am <laughter> but xxx it's
38,1002.4,1004.22,Participant,my desire to take responsibility
38,1005.12,1013.02,Participant,for everyone and everything that i care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine and i know other people i can't really
38,1013.88,1017.4,Participant,direct them into my own vision because they're their own
38,1018.8,1020.06,Participant,individual beings
38,1021.22,1023.06,Participant,and they can't you know
38,1023.94,1026.37,Participant,be what i want them to be and i know they're not going to be
38,1027.64,1029.88,Participant,but i still have you know my ideals
38,1030.43,1038.61,Participant,and i want the way i want everything to go and i want everybody that i care about to be happy and to be able too 
38,1041.78,1043.41,Participant,fit into my life
38,1044.28,1050.32,Participant,in a way in the best way possible but i know 'cause they're other beings
38,1050.86,1058.26,Participant,and i know i'm not gonna be able to do that for them and they're not gonna be able to do that for me but it's still my ideals <laughter> so i have to sometimes have to look at it and go well
38,1056.14,1056.54,Ellie,mhm
38,1058.71,1065.39,Participant,is this what i want because i want it or what is what they want and what's their <thei> is it their decision or mine and it's usually it's theirs
38,1065.95,1070.92,Participant,and i know it's theirs so i so if you really care about somebody you're just gonna support them and go with them but 
38,1066.09,1066.44,Ellie,yeah
38,1072.24,1072.74,Participant,it's still
38,1074.24,1077.78,Participant,kinda hard <laughter> for for me and know i gotta get over it
38,1078.81,1079.26,Ellie,yeah
38,1080.42,1083.23,Ellie,what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
38,1085.26,1085.87,Participant,um
38,1088.5,1090.1,Participant,ten or twenty years ago
38,1095.9,1103.27,Participant,probably to have been more assertive in starting my own life because i wound taking care of my mother i mean she
38,1104.28,1111.9,Participant,got sick literally the weekend i graduated from college <laughter> and i had a job lined up and i had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her
38,1112.41,1116.25,Participant,and i think i would've been more aggressive about starting my own life getting a job outside 
38,1117.04,1128.92,Participant,the house in addition to caring for her getting uh my own job history my own credit history thing like things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about ten years
38,1125.3,1125.62,Ellie,uh huh
38,1129.89,1130.37,Participant,so
38,1131.0,1132.77,Participant,i think i i probably would've done that
38,1133.86,1139.69,Participant,um but i tell myself just do that you keep who you are and learn to separate
38,1141.4,1145.63,Participant,your you who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family
38,1146.3,1156.54,Participant,to keep a sense of of yourself that's probably what i would've and do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself that's probably the advance advice of what i would give myself   
38,1154.02,1154.4,Ellie,mhm
38,1157.02,1158.58,Participant,ten years ago <laughter>

38,1166.6,1168.39,Ellie,have you been diagnosed with depression
38,1169.12,1174.12,Participant,no but probably 'cause i haven't gone to a doctor about it <laughter> 'cause i don't wanna know
38,1175.84,1176.68,Participant,and i mean it's not
38,1177.42,1183.42,Participant,i know there've been times in my life where i've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances
38,1184.24,1190.23,Participant,and had to pull myself out of it but i'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment
38,1191.36,1192.13,Participant,and of it gets <ge>
38,1191.57,1192.84,Ellie,can you give me an example of that
38,1194.1,1194.63,Participant,um
38,1196.1,1204.42,Participant,after my mother had died i mean it'd been this long battle for a year that we lost and i didn't know
38,1205.84,1209.48,Participant,if i if i was to blame for that it's like logically i knew i wasn't
38,1210.31,1210.61,Participant,but
38,1212.4,1214.15,Participant,how could i convince myself of that
38,1215.46,1218.8,Participant,um two weeks after she died i wound up with
38,1220.32,1221.61,Participant,pulmonary embolisms
38,1222.3,1230.13,Participant,in one in each lung because i didn't take care of myself for a year and i figured oh i'm thirty years old if
38,1230.77,1237.97,Participant,you know whatever i do to myself i can get over no <laughter> turns out no <laughter> but um
38,1238.54,1240.78,Participant,i mean i wound up having to take more medication
38,1241.51,1242.34,Participant,because of that
38,1243.26,1247.21,Participant,uh it's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to
38,1248.02,1253.6,Participant,get out of that depression 'cause so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter all of a sudden i didn't it's like
38,1255.56,1260.61,Participant,the rug was pulled out my like bottom fell out of my world after that so
38,1259.82,1260.23,Ellie,yeah
38,1261.36,1271.56,Participant,that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression um i almost got divorced because of it because i just didn't want anything anymore 
38,1272.28,1272.83,Participant,so
38,1273.34,1283.29,Participant,and i was i being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point and i started getting very distant from him just pushing everything away just
38,1284.52,1286.78,Participant,you know figuring well what am i gonna do with the rest of my life now
38,1288.02,1288.42,Participant,and it
38,1289.39,1290.06,Participant,it's been
38,1291.44,1294.57,Participant,a fight you know you mean there times when no i couldn't get up
38,1295.76,1298.87,Participant,just stay in bed and sleep all day you know
38,1299.6,1300.1,Participant,but then
38,1301.24,1302.55,Participant,realizing that
38,1304.7,1311.55,Participant,when my mother died i had four cats to look after two are mine two are hers and so i wound up adopting the two that were hers i mean well
38,1312.58,1319.29,Participant,they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own you know own own supplies
38,1319.62,1319.96,Ellie,uh huh
38,1320.52,1322.58,Participant,i took that responsibility of doing it for them
38,1323.82,1336.65,Participant,so that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not i was gonna get up and provide for them i mean i could go without eating i could go without taking care of myself but they couldn't
38,1337.48,1337.95,Ellie,yeah
38,1337.56,1338.87,Participant,they didn't you know so
38,1339.62,1342.35,Participant,they eh they actually got me up and
38,1344.92,1356.81,Participant,and made me go out and face things even though i didn't want to didn't just didn't just kinda wanted to curl up and die but that would've been my choice not theirs and they i mean what would happen to them
38,1357.56,1360.66,Participant,if i wasn't there to take care of them they would've been
38,1361.65,1364.36,Participant,you know sent to a shelter or whatever probably 
38,1364.96,1371.91,Participant,and maybe they would've not been readopt me home and adopted by somebody else maybe they would have been killed for 
38,1372.84,1377.28,Participant,for me i mean for me making selfish decisions  
38,1374.04,1374.42,Ellie,mhm
38,1378.03,1386.16,Participant,so it's like i need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed <laughter> so <s> and that's actually been a motivating factor is
38,1386.79,1396.74,Participant,to to 'cause i've figured out that if it was just me i'd be able to live without a lot of stuff i mean i would be able to live in my car if i wanted it wouldn't be a big deal i wouldn't care  
38,1397.15,1400.15,Participant,as long as i was doing what i wanted with my life but
38,1401.27,1403.26,Participant,i have a family to look after now 
38,1404.28,1406.03,Participant,so i have to go out and do things 
38,1406.49,1406.89,Ellie,yeah
38,1406.65,1411.97,Participant,you know i i have to go out and look for legitimate work you know day you know day job i have to you know  
38,1412.55,1418.76,Participant,but i'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what i wanna do with my life but yet i have to take care of my family so i'm  
38,1419.45,1421.88,Participant,been working on on a balance of the two
38,1422.5,1423.44,Ellie,how hard is that 
38,1425.0,1427.84,Participant,very <laughter> but it's worth it
38,1428.74,1429.23,Participant,i mean 
38,1430.57,1437.75,Participant,it would be very i'd have a lot less things to worry about if i just lived in my car and said forget it <laughter> 
38,1438.46,1440.03,Participant,but keeping
38,1441.07,1443.84,Participant,a residence down paying bills things like that 
38,1446.05,1454.18,Participant,it's it's difficult but you have to do it you know if you want you want anything <anyth> if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that 
38,1454.8,1455.27,Ellie,yeah
38,1455.38,1456.86,Participant,and i and and i know that 
38,1457.73,1458.05,Participant,but 
38,1458.7,1461.38,Participant,it it gets hard sometimes you do wanna give up 
38,1462.11,1462.59,Participant,but then 
38,1463.52,1465.49,Participant,it's like well what's the alternative 
38,1467.02,1469.44,Participant,i mean i don't think i could live a comfortable life 
38,1470.24,1477.03,Participant,'cause if i did i wouldn't do anything <laughter> i have to be slightly uncomfortable or i'm not gonna do anything with myself i'm just gonna 
38,1477.85,1483.33,Participant,be content to just hang out all day stay in bed hang out with my cats or whatever 
38,1484.28,1485.5,Participant,and i wouldn't get anything done 
38,1486.6,1487.13,Ellie,i see
38,1488.19,1489.72,Ellie,how have you been feeling lately 
38,1490.94,1491.98,Participant,uh very 
38,1492.74,1496.78,Participant,anxious and nervous and i mean what if 
38,1498.04,1499.17,Participant,i don't find 
38,1500.56,1506.7,Participant,enough you know enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if um 
38,1508.52,1509.94,Participant,you know what what if i can't  
38,1511.62,1511.99,Participant,keep
38,1513.19,1521.03,Participant,a semblance of stability in my life and it it's actually hard work to be stable <laughter> and i know it's hard work to be stable but 
38,1522.31,1525.1,Participant,what you know it's just eh a lot of what ifs 
38,1525.93,1532.2,Participant,and and i don't think it's things that haven't happened and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened and i know that 
38,1532.76,1534.84,Participant,but it still happens <ha> it still creeps in 
38,1535.87,1537.33,Participant,so that's actually 
38,1538.62,1540.19,Participant,a source of 
38,1541.93,1542.69,Participant,anxiety 
38,1543.93,1550.67,Participant,but then you try to let the anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it 
38,1551.97,1553.66,Participant,but i i i know it it's a cycle
38,1552.65,1553.19,Ellie,that's good 
38,1554.34,1561.17,Participant,and i'll go from being really anxious and oh my god what am i gonna do what am i gonna do to saying okay what is
38,1562.37,1564.25,Participant,the fundamental thing i need to take of here 
38,1565.33,1570.21,Participant,i mean what <wha> what is just extraneous and what can <c> what can what
38,1571.05,1574.15,Participant,is what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue 
38,1574.62,1575.07,Ellie,mhm
38,1575.13,1575.63,Participant,and so 
38,1576.77,1580.39,Participant,figure out how to figure things out that way and then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit
38,1581.05,1584.52,Participant,but then something'll pop up and the what ifs will come up again 
38,1585.3,1586.67,Participant,mm i'll have to 
38,1587.97,1588.32,Participant,uh 
38,1589.62,1599.5,Participant,figure it out again <laughter> but i know it's a cycle i know um what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it  
38,1600.2,1602.11,Participant,you get over it pretty quickly you get through it 
38,1602.79,1603.29,Ellie,yes
38,1604.98,1607.48,Ellie,when was the last time you felt really happy 
38,1609.02,1610.94,Participant,the last time i felt really happy
38,1613.2,1613.84,Participant,i don't know
38,1614.66,1614.99,Participant,zz
38,1617.84,1618.59,Participant,um
38,1622.65,1622.87,Participant,i 
38,1626.35,1631.21,Participant,huh <laughter> that's a good question that actually <ac> that actually surprisingly stumped me 
38,1632.17,1638.09,Participant,because i do feel happy sometimes sometimes not so much sometimes just kinda
38,1638.89,1640.1,Participant,eh in the middle
38,1641.07,1641.5,Participant,um
38,1642.89,1646.75,Participant,really like overjoyously happy i don't know 
38,1648.46,1652.78,Participant,i i'm not i can't think of <o> of when that happened
38,1655.22,1655.7,Ellie,okay 
38,1657.88,1659.46,Ellie,how would your best friend describe you 
38,1663.93,1665.14,Participant,i don't know you don't know 
38,1666.08,1668.33,Participant,perceptions of other people i mean 
38,1671.34,1673.3,Participant,probably as somebody who 
38,1676.55,1681.15,Participant,oddly enough somebody who is laid back and you know 
38,1682.48,1685.46,Participant,handles things as they come but i don't see myself as that  
38,1685.99,1686.32,Participant,at all
38,1687.58,1688.12,Participant,and it's a it
38,1687.85,1690.19,Ellie,what would you say are some of your best qualities 
38,1691.83,1695.3,Participant,probably that i can think on my feet and
38,1695.94,1697.67,Participant,i'm not afraid to 
38,1699.01,1703.6,Participant,hussle my butt off and do whatever i have to to survive and get things done 
38,1704.76,1705.69,Participant,um that 
38,1707.26,1709.37,Participant,and i can do it creatively and i try to 
38,1710.59,1711.91,Participant,strive for balance 
38,1712.44,1712.76,Participant,probably

50,739.76,750.47,Participant,are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time it doesn't mean that you're less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their

52,542.21,549.08,Participant,like was overwhelmed with how pretty it was and i was just like oh i can't believe that i get to live here so that was definitely a happy moment for me <laughter> 
52,550.78,552.28,Ellie,how would your best friend describe you

52,603.25,614.31,Participant,i've tried moving all different places by myself so i think just the fact that i i'm not really afraid i don't let things hold me back i just if i want something or if i wanna do something i can just do it and
52,614.54,626.33,Participant,i guess in a way like i like that about myself and the fact that i'm really independent and can just go and do whatever i feel like doing even if it's hard i still i'm proud that i've overcome a lot of those struggles 
52,627.34,628.38,Ellie,is there anything you regret 
52,630.33,642.72,Participant,oh there's like minor things that i regret throughout my life but there's not anything really major 'cause i think pretty much everything that i've done i've learned from whether it's good or bad so

52,666.26,666.68,Participant,um
52,667.43,676.92,Participant,i guess as i've grown into an adult i've really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and if you really want something you can go after it and you can get it so i would just
52,677.47,681.79,Participant,tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you wanna do 
52,684.15,687.46,Ellie,tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed

64,209.082,215.502,Participant,but also another hour and a half two hours away you can go to arrowhead or big bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that
64,215.877,218.937,Participant,and uh i think it's a great place to live

64,228.037,229.307,Participant,more of some maybe some of the
64,229.737,232.732,Participant,things i don't like about l_a or say california in general
64,233.032,234.582,Participant,say like the high tax rate
64,235.152,239.912,Participant,which the state tax rate is up to thirteen point something now
64,240.167,243.157,Participant,which is gonna chase business out of here also the regulations
64,243.317,244.787,Participant,i'm a small business owner
64,245.327,256.142,Participant,so all the regulations are clearly affecting business so many of my peers have moved their businesses to texas arizona nevada etcetera some of the other western states that are less regulated
64,256.76,259.99,Participant,and uh that's a big problem here in uh
64,260.25,262.16,Participant,uh california
64,262.55,263.39,Ellie,that_sucks (that sucks)
64,263.485,267.21,Participant,it really does most people don't understand it but  it's uh
64,267.96,269.06,Participant,also uh
64,270.315,276.67,Participant,you know besides the high taxes you know there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don't
64,277.127,280.937,Participant,see that but it's a big tax on the social service system
64,281.337,283.107,Participant,and that's what makes our taxes
64,283.507,287.477,Participant,uh so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of
64,288.065,288.535,Ellie,mm (mm)
64,288.627,289.447,Participant,so that's
64,290.092,300.099,Participant,you know but people don't seem to want to really deal with uh deal with that but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state
64,300.925,301.435,Ellie,mhm (mhm)
64,302.213,308.394,Ellie,travel_shoes (i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot)

64,313.559,315.689,Participant,i don't travel as much as i used to
64,315.989,318.159,Participant,but i've traveled quite a bit

64,326.269,327.299,Participant,uh
64,328.919,331.099,Participant,i didn't really understand uh your question
64,332.634,337.949,Participant,when you said like what i don't think you understood what i said but i'll just go back and
64,339.144,341.874,Participant,i've been all through europe eastern europe

64,346.644,354.344,Participant,um and i enjoy that and enjoy warm climates now especially where you can go and relax and there's warm water to surf
64,354.564,357.004,Participant,'cause the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up
64,357.859,361.439,Participant,and i also like to exercise and surf and do yoga
64,361.704,364.174,Participant,and work out and uh
64,364.434,366.294,Participant,i try to eat healthy and uh
64,366.954,369.224,Participant,that's a big part of my life
64,369.869,371.549,Ellie,travel_trips (i'd love to hear about one of your trips)
64,371.744,372.214,Participant,oh
64,372.574,373.274,Participant,sure
64,373.499,383.219,Participant,um one of my favorite trips of all time was i used to when i was younger see how many countries i could do in a relatively short period of time say in a three or four week span
64,383.501,391.191,Participant,but about ten years ago we actually went to paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though i'd been there about ten times
64,391.511,395.571,Participant,we got to know the city really well which was great really lived like a local
64,395.856,397.896,Participant,and rented a small flat and
64,398.661,401.151,Participant,cooked and did our own shopping but really
64,401.566,404.896,Participant,having been there so many times i really never stayed for more than three or four days
64,405.296,410.561,Participant,it was fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and uh really get to learn the city
64,410.861,414.461,Participant,and it was fun even though i grew up in l_a i grew up taking french
64,414.826,419.711,Participant,which there wasn't a big spanish speaking population when i when i was younger
64,419.956,422.446,Participant,my mother insisted that all of us kids
64,422.656,427.886,Participant,take french even though spanish would've been a lot more valuable but i took french uh
64,428.716,433.256,Participant,all through uh elementary junior high and uh high school
64,433.834,434.564,Ellie,nice (nice)
64,434.126,439.326,Participant,so it was nice to practice my french even though i don't remember a whole lot and even though i stopped speaking french
64,439.486,440.486,Participant,with the french
64,440.721,446.106,Participant,you know and my accent is not the greatest so after a couple sentences they start talking english to me
64,446.343,447.143,Ellie,wild_laughter3 ((laughter))
64,447.666,449.801,Participant,<laughter> so that was a
64,449.679,450.819,Ellie,study (what did you study at school)
64,451.421,452.311,Participant,uh
64,452.851,454.951,Participant,i have a few different degrees
64,455.456,459.781,Participant,so uh i was a naval science major as an undergraduate
64,461.131,462.541,Participant,and uh
64,462.911,463.961,Participant,that was fun
64,464.331,465.781,Participant,and i also have a masters
64,466.101,468.061,Participant,uh degree in economics
64,468.886,471.266,Participant,and i have a degree in crisis management
64,472.581,473.021,Participant,so
64,473.059,474.489,Ellie,change_directions (what made you decide to do that)
64,475.061,476.761,Participant,uh i found them um
64,477.276,478.386,Participant,interesting
64,478.796,479.996,Participant,and uh
64,480.901,482.601,Participant,it was something that i wanted to do
64,482.736,486.921,Participant,where i went to college i went to the naval academy i went there to play sports
64,487.301,491.766,Participant,and  i found it real interesting being from southern california going to school in maryland
64,492.231,494.271,Participant,and i originally wanted to be a doctor but
64,494.716,496.416,Participant,once you start going to school
64,496.641,498.731,Participant,for a little bit you change your mind
64,499.101,500.381,Participant,etcetera so
64,500.335,500.845,Ellie,mhm (mhm)
64,502.673,503.933,Ellie,still_working_on_X (are you still working in that)
64,504.686,508.986,Participant,um i'm actually in the wholesale business now
64,509.486,512.751,Participant,for wholesale distributors of furniture products
64,513.566,517.276,Participant,and it was a family business but i went to work there a number of years ago
64,517.56,522.895,Participant,well you know my grandfather and recently father passed away so i sort of run a eighty year old family business
64,523.15,524.57,Participant,and it's
64,525.095,527.825,Participant,pretty interesting i like it having grown up around it
64,528.175,530.635,Participant,but it's different than other jobs i've had in the past
64,531.429,532.629,Ellie,dream_job (what's your dream job)
64,533.83,534.47,Participant,hm
64,534.875,542.18,Participant,actually probably my dream job i think cooking and staying at home this fun i've changed so much i enjoy cooking and staying at home
64,542.705,544.125,Participant,and uh
64,545.14,545.98,Participant,uh
64,546.665,551.315,Participant,i would probably like to stay home and raise kids because i do have one daughter
64,551.99,553.2,Participant,and uh
64,552.325,553.005,Ellie,aw (aw)
64,553.955,557.735,Participant,you know didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as i would've liked
64,558.32,566.85,Participant,but i think i would be better than say a lot of women i know  that want to work i actually like cooking and hanging around the house and taking care of kids
64,567.25,575.34,Participant,you know that i like doing i'm always on a part time basis but do that having pretty much worked most of my life it seems like boy that would be fun to stay home and uh do that having pretty much worked most of my life
64,575.54,576.04,Participant,so
64,576.082,576.552,Ellie,yeah3 (yeah)
64,576.5,579.23,Participant,probably never happen but it sounds something that to me would be fun
64,582.084,586.503,Ellie,shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing)
64,585.72,591.42,Participant,uh i think i'm um generally more reserved and shy with strangers
64,591.84,594.65,Participant,but when i get to know someone or feel comfortable
64,595.25,597.68,Participant,i think i'm more of an extrovert
64,598.28,601.29,Participant,whereas most strangers might think i'm more introverted
64,601.48,612.68,Participant,but i think i'm when i feel comfortable with certain people and i don't know what it is i can meet a stranger and  be totally confident or people that i might've known for years either from a personal or a business situation
64,613.84,616.61,Participant,and be more um
64,617.29,618.32,Participant,introverted
64,618.89,627.025,Participant,i mean i just i just go with the dynamics but i think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy in general and reserved <reser> i use like to use the term reserved
64,628.051,628.511,Ellie,okay_confirm (okay)
64,631.516,643.294,Ellie,relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)
64,643.152,646.072,Participant,oh wow that's a great idea i used to have that on uh
64,646.587,649.412,Participant,one of my i have uh several computers at home
64,649.972,653.222,Participant,and that used to be one of my screensavers uh as well
64,653.752,667.922,Participant,i usually tend when when i need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events or going for a long walk or going for a long walk or going for a long walk i usually find exercise whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach
64,668.457,673.082,Participant,you know maybe going surfing when the weather's warm i don't surf in cold weather anymore because it makes
64,674.012,677.737,Participant,it gives me like a brain freeze even though i've surfed for you know over thirty years
64,678.302,679.182,Participant,i had
64,679.707,680.477,Participant,it uh
64,681.217,684.827,Participant,i usually find exercise helps me relax the best
64,685.107,689.287,Participant,or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the t_v i find very relaxing <laughter>
64,690.952,695.895,Participant,but i like that screensaver i used to have that on one of my uh screensavers at home but
64,696.526,697.426,Ellie,thats_great (that's great)
64,698.215,699.945,Participant,yes that was uh
64,700.235,701.165,Participant,that was it but
64,701.515,706.535,Participant,that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master though were my relaxation skills
64,706.7,709.54,Participant,i probably didn't have them the best in my twenties but over the years
64,710.01,711.8,Participant,i think i've gotten better
64,712.53,713.905,Participant,uh at the
64,712.868,713.398,Ellie,yeah2 (yeah)
64,714.74,717.28,Participant,i think that's a key thing and i think as we mature
64,717.795,720.615,Participant,as we learn how to do that i wish i'd learned how to do that and
64,721.165,722.295,Participant,be a little more
64,722.815,724.925,Participant,how do you had had the skills earlier
64,727.187,729.247,Ellie,control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
64,729.965,734.38,Participant,i like to think i'm pretty good i think i'm a lot better as well as that as i've aged
64,734.99,736.06,Participant,um
64,736.45,737.41,Participant,you know i
64,738.235,742.355,Participant,i am more likely to think before i speak now
64,742.58,746.44,Participant,whereas say twenty years ago i was more likely to act before i fought
64,747.115,749.245,Participant,so i might've said more things that i
64,750.105,753.775,Participant,in a whatever tense situation whether it be personal or
64,754.3,755.75,Participant,a work situation
64,756.48,757.45,Participant,um
64,757.75,765.025,Participant,but i've never had a a a violent temper but i would have a temper where i fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and reflecting on it
64,765.31,769.72,Participant,i think i'm a lot better at that  now than i was say in my teens or twenties
64,769.903,770.373,Ellie,uh_huh (uh huh)
64,771.34,775.42,Participant,so when i think a lot of that comes i think the keyword there is maturity
64,776.754,779.804,Ellie,last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
64,779.83,780.85,Participant,oh wow
64,781.275,786.595,Participant,you know i haven't really had an argument with anybody in several years <y> what i would consider a traditional
64,787.64,789.53,Participant,argument um
64,790.26,791.33,Participant,probably
64,792.39,793.28,Participant,um
64,793.67,798.62,Participant,my ex wife a number of years ago wehad an argument basically just over my daughter
64,799.12,801.55,Participant,and it wasn't anything violent but it was heated just
64,801.7,806.885,Participant,basically one of the reasons we didn't weren't married our values were so different just our ideas of parenting
64,807.71,809.31,Participant,and uh just
64,810.155,813.415,Participant,uh outlook on life was so different i think that caused
64,813.84,817.03,Participant,us to butt heads but it was just i don't know if i'd call it an argument
64,817.44,821.755,Participant,but it was more of just a uh one of those let's agree to disagree
64,822.28,823.15,Participant,butt heads
64,823.37,823.89,Participant,so

70,901.65,908.96,Participant,you know it was just kinda rewording things and it it seemed just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of of changing things and
70,909.56,915.11,Participant,i kinda took personal offense to that just uh because i thought i had a lot more experience and more education and uh
70,916.0,921.91,Participant,it it was unnecessary you know i i thought that the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just um
70,922.95,929.84,Participant,i i didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to to necessarily redo all our work um or or even to uh
70,930.91,937.89,Participant,not not to redo it but to to edit it or to uh <sigh> not <no> eh proofread i guess to to make any kind of
70,938.82,946.72,Participant,you know qualitative changes i i just thought that it was a a really bad idea and and i i thought that i you know i i shouldn't have viewed it this way but i thought that
70,947.51,954.83,Participant,the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know was kind of like a an affront to us who had worked on it on this project but

72,748.69,750.21,Participant,and have everything that he wants

73,1007.19,1014.33,Participant,um hardships and obstacles and uh having that image of knowing my father on it's very very humanizing 'cause it's so easy to kind of

74,1008.19,1018.81,Participant,so he like sat me down on this conversation and was like you know our major client that is like you know the bread and butter of the company they're the they're really cutting back like you probably notice things are getting really slow and i was like yeah
74,1019.2,1022.72,Participant,and he's like so i'm gonna <onna> i'm gonna <onna> have to stop paying you your retainer
74,1023.78,1028.48,Participant,and this was a total surprise but i was just like okay and he went on to talk about how
74,1029.2,1029.73,Participant,he
74,1030.35,1037.96,Participant,i would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came through the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know

74,1040.38,1045.43,Participant,he would throw enough work at me still that like i wouldn't you know it wouldn't be like a dramatic

74,1051.15,1057.28,Participant,but um and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work i love working with you you're fantastic
74,1058.3,1059.67,Participant,yada yada so
74,1060.29,1064.02,Participant,to make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me
74,1064.45,1070.8,Participant,um and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point
74,1071.23,1073.62,Participant,he stopped calling me he stopped emailing me
74,1073.98,1077.17,Participant,and later on like a couple of months down the road

74,1103.92,1110.55,Participant,it was a really <rea> <laughter> it was a really shitty way to be like fired without being told that i was fired um and it was just like
74,1111.98,1122.51,Participant,that uh the reason i would like i if i could i would erase that from my mind is because i can't really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like

80,838.654,839.432,Participant,um
80,841.154,846.945,Participant,they think that like there's some there's some sort of they'll as i understand it they have um
80,848.505,852.818,Participant,they have a certain uh they think that the
80,853.997,862.417,Participant,like all of the stories within boogie nights they have their own um like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there's a whole like
80,862.9,866.051,Participant,complexity of character within the movie
80,866.54,867.84,Participant,and um
80,868.96,870.131,Participant,that somehow like
80,871.37,872.961,Participant,<sigh> um
80,874.6,878.281,Participant,what what were they saying they were saying like the movie
80,883.47,886.05,Participant,it like xxx it's like the end of an era
80,886.471,894.25,Participant,which makes it like kinda like casino and there's this attention to detail of of of the in the different character like how they
80,894.66,896.43,Participant,how they interact in the plot
80,896.79,897.551,Participant,um
80,898.04,899.021,Participant,kind of like
80,899.99,900.751,Participant,uh
80,903.0,904.1,Participant,yeah i guess
80,904.75,911.54,Participant,i think the heated debate became about like then so from there and uh like personally i it's not like a bad movie or anything but it's
80,912.05,913.081,Participant,the um
80,913.89,918.46,Participant,i just don't think dirk diggler is like that like meaningful <mean> meaningful of a character like i
80,918.971,926.78,Participant,i guess the way i come out i came out of the movie 'cause i had seen it before many years ago and eh i my opinion of it is basically the same even though like i remember like
80,922.979,923.449,Ellie,mm (mm)
80,927.43,930.15,Participant,in watching it again i was able to reevaluate it
80,930.571,939.89,Participant,um there's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing articulable <art> like articulable about that's it's like solid <so> good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool
80,940.29,940.821,Participant,um
80,941.36,945.46,Participant,the eh it really <rea> you know it's cool it's but
80,945.98,954.55,Participant,but it's meaningless <mea> for me it was like meaningless and then to and then there were that led us to discuss 'cause a movie that i saw recently that i really did like was django unchained
80,954.664,955.194,Ellie,yeah2 (yeah)
80,954.82,957.22,Participant,and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie
80,957.65,961.6,Participant,and then there was this extreme i guess the heated part of the conversation came about like
80,962.03,964.071,Participant,so in the movie django unchained
80,964.44,972.371,Participant,um you have django and django is like a kinda he's a two dimensional character but i don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big
80,972.991,973.131,Participant,the
80,973.64,975.25,Participant,big purpose of the movie is
80,975.403,975.793,Ellie,right2 (right)
80,975.73,976.481,Participant,and um
80,977.28,979.49,Participant,and you have doctor king schultz who's this uh
80,979.93,985.46,Participant,who's this like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with was saying that he
80,986.04,993.64,Participant,was intelligent and uh so and because he was intelligent there's no way he would've risked his life to save django
80,994.01,1003.65,Participant,or like would've gone into this like second act where they go and they go to this uh uh plantation to to save django's wife etcetera
80,1004.15,1004.871,Participant,and um
80,1005.44,1018.151,Participant,and the reason <rea> the the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not
80,1018.651,1021.48,Participant,sacrifice themself for someone else
80,1021.539,1022.269,Ellie,hmmB (hmm)
80,1022.06,1025.52,Participant,um which strikes <stri> which strikes me as so like
80,1026.021,1026.541,Participant,um
80,1028.28,1029.01,Participant,like who
80,1029.42,1031.64,Participant,uh like
80,1032.48,1034.57,Participant,she she her basic <ba> her basic argument was that
80,1035.07,1040.51,Participant,altruism <al> like altruism doesn't exist <exi> it was a very ayn rand type argument altruism doesn't exist
80,1040.83,1047.56,Participant,um the only the only thing you can do is serve <ser> like the only thing people do is serve themself
80,1047.941,1055.18,Participant,um so it's not quite ayn rand but it's like the only people <peo> thing that people <peo> like all people are out to serve themself which i'm not arguing that like
80,1055.651,1068.041,Participant,every decision has like a mix of altruism and and so like even the most altruistic type decision there's maybe like kernels of self self-interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor
80,1068.311,1068.781,Ellie,yeah3 (yeah)
80,1068.45,1075.27,Participant,in and and like what but what how how horrible is your life if that's like what your ultimate um
80,1076.92,1083.8,Participant,purpose <pur> like if you if you can't like love and sacrifice for other people so it led into an extremely uh passionate debate
80,1084.14,1084.941,Participant,um
80,1085.37,1086.271,Participant,and uh
80,1087.111,1089.631,Participant,somewhat like yeah and it's it uh
80,1090.761,1099.0,Participant,so um so yeah that that i guess that's the the i don't think i necessarily like lost my temper um
80,1099.38,1101.63,Participant,i think of losing my temper as being more
80,1103.8,1104.441,Participant,um
80,1105.84,1106.39,Participant,like i just
80,1106.811,1108.271,Participant,so <s> i i would so <s>
80,1109.33,1113.23,Participant,revert to um ad hominem like attacks
80,1113.82,1116.89,Participant,uh but i i didn't like that's not um
80,1117.351,1122.778,Participant,maybe i was like maybe i was criticizing <crit> like criticizing her world view but it i wasn't like

109,298.57,308.94,Participant,mental energy reflecting all of it when gut wise you always know what the choice what you really wanna do is and it doesn't matter whether there's a ninety eight percent chance of failure
109,309.26,317.98,Participant,even if it's a two percent chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield you joy so i always go to that it's it's to me a waste of total time
109,318.46,326.45,Participant,and energy to even think about another choice 'cause who cares if you remain unscathed but it when it yields no joy

109,369.28,374.37,Participant,in somebody else's shoes rather than the way you would react you have to have more empathy

109,519.0,521.76,Participant,and he said something about are you aware of
109,522.57,523.96,Participant,past lives and
109,524.52,528.68,Participant,i had told him that i was buddhist and i was kind of curious that
109,529.34,538.96,Participant,if you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed and to be able to talk to them
109,539.301,539.831,Ellie,yeah2 (yeah)
109,539.39,541.65,Participant,and i and he said that are you aware that
109,542.53,543.36,Participant,um
109,543.67,547.19,Participant,<tisk> about something in your past and i go yes i believe that
109,547.61,553.54,Participant,many religions uh including buddhisms and scientology believe that things that you have <ha> have
109,554.44,560.42,Participant,had in your history sometimes affect you or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness
109,560.94,564.91,Participant,um resulting from even your past relationships or your
109,565.24,574.02,Participant,parents and such can affect and make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and also <a> we also believe i said that
109,574.88,582.42,Participant,you know that you have the power of each person has a god like or a buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself
109,582.9,586.31,Participant,even when i'm on the verge of possibly being i probably get one cold
109,586.87,590.76,Participant,maybe every fifteen years i don't have a tendency to be sick at all
109,591.1,593.98,Participant,and a large part of it is i think when i think i'm on the verge
109,594.46,595.17,Participant,i take
109,595.71,599.53,Participant,sort of like and i did this even when i was a child uh when i was seven i would
109,600.17,601.68,Participant,fold down i had my boo boo

109,606.04,610.11,Participant,you know help the bad part <laughter> from a simplistic way in terms of a child
109,607.513,607.903,Ellie,right2 (right)
109,610.66,612.4,Participant,and i would actually
109,612.96,618.16,Participant,even when i was in a very severe car accident where i got cut by glass my whole back
109,618.51,621.78,Participant,i concentrated healing and and when i went back to the hospital
109,622.44,626.56,Participant,the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that
109,626.93,634.67,Participant,just <jj> her last week her back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so i believe that but uh
109,635.48,636.08,Participant,um
109,637.48,642.68,Participant,uh but i was just i think annoyed and irritated a little because the scientologist told me that
109,643.68,650.88,Participant,because he had taken twenty or forty courses and he these certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and
109,651.29,654.83,Participant,it didn't <did> it wasn't even a matter i said of whether he was
109,655.63,661.85,Participant,um whether he took twenty forty courses or whether i'd been practicing buddhism whether it was for five ten fifteen
109,662.34,671.1,Participant,twenty years or whether somebody'd been practicing some type of christianity for fifty years and bending sitting in a church pew every day it doesn't mean this person could have
109,671.44,675.37,Participant,never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has
109,675.889,676.419,Ellie,yeah2 (yeah)
109,676.0,676.4,Participant,you know
109,676.82,680.51,Participant,so i just was thinking that was the antithesis of
109,681.37,685.45,Participant,somebody who says they're enlightened but it's just the way i guess he kept cramming his
109,686.96,687.48,Participant,uh
109,687.89,694.58,Participant,you know his faith down my throat that after a while i was pretty patient with him but he it was so pompous that i became irritated
109,695.132,695.602,Ellie,yeah3 (yeah)
109,696.19,701.69,Participant,especially when he kept telling me that it was audited and yet the same person needed a hip surgery
109,696.492,697.442,Ellie,understand (i understand)
109,702.57,703.9,Participant,uh the following week
109,704.22,706.97,Participant,and i didn't point it out to him 'cause i just didn't wanna get
109,707.47,708.19,Participant,into it but
109,708.73,720.05,Participant,one could say hey you have a bad hip 'cause you need to be audited that that something that you did in your past otherwise you wouldn't need to get a hip surgery i mean i believe to some extent things that can be caused
109,720.3,721.65,Participant,by people themselves
109,722.21,726.98,Participant,and then he's flippantly said well are you aware of scientologists believe that
109,727.88,729.97,Participant,past lives can also affect
109,730.64,735.1,Participant,you know and i'm thinking to myself buddhists of all religions are
109,736.32,743.59,Participant,are kind of like well known for you know believing in in a cause and effect and past lives situations and i found my thought
109,744.15,748.2,Participant,he should really read up if he's trying to convert other people <laughter> from other religions so
109,748.64,749.74,Participant,but um
109,750.39,753.1,Participant,<tisk> you know i i you know i i just didn't
109,753.47,756.17,Participant,you know care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it <laughter>
109,755.987,756.457,Ellie,yeah3 (yeah)
109,757.79,759.14,Participant,but other than that i mean i don't

109,770.89,771.94,Participant,uh <sigh>
109,772.73,775.74,Participant,sometimes to have a little more tact i guess when

136,557.53,559.4,Participant,you know harder to obtain
136,559.93,563.06,Participant,so i just thought eh i would go into something more realistic

137,459.2,468.56,Participant,and i used to look at them and say no i'm not gonna be like them i'm gonna travel i'm not gonna just stay home i i mean i mean <me> there's nothing wrong with 'em because they
137,469.22,477.65,Participant,found love at home <laughter> and did things at home but they never really traveled anywhere and my mom used she was afraid of planes for one
137,478.14,487.33,Participant,and i used to try to talk her into get on a plane and go somewhere and she said oh i'm gonna go here i'm going to go there but she never did she died she never did do <d> do any travel
137,487.78,488.95,Participant,so i've made up for her
137,489.805,496.155,Participant,and uh i i want to do something different and that's to to travel more than and be more out there
137,496.61,501.21,Participant,i was more of a social butterfly my mother was a not a social butterfly

137,503.898,504.358,Ellie,okay_confirm (okay)
137,505.597,507.657,Ellie,control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
137,508.67,510.31,Participant,i think before i speak

137,515.43,519.18,Participant,i take on other people's feelings before i um
137,519.99,522.11,Participant,blurt out the wrong thing i try to
137,522.65,525.23,Participant,uh analyze the situation first
137,525.73,533.2,Participant,before <bef> because sometimes you can put your <yo> open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you may not be able to get out of
137,533.596,534.126,Ellie,yeah2 (yeah)
137,536.451,539.501,Ellie,last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
137,540.64,541.41,Participant,um
137,544.195,554.905,Participant,<laughter> it's probably something about my husband did <laughter> oh he <h> i know what it was it's about uh well probably over some construction <cons> new construction that my husband is working on on our house
137,556.39,559.09,Participant,uh we had a disagreement on that um
137,559.6,562.54,Participant,men have their own way of doing things and um
137,563.03,566.4,Participant,i had told him not to use a certain uh
137,567.08,569.28,Participant,eh person to work on our house
137,569.88,574.55,Participant,but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead
137,574.95,577.18,Participant,and now he sees all the downfalls
137,577.54,581.31,Participant,and he didn't listen and so i didn't say i told you so
137,581.66,584.32,Participant,but i guess he can tell by my facial expression
137,584.93,590.87,Participant,that uh he he'd have done wrong and i told him i said look you're losing money
137,591.35,598.49,Participant,and it became one problem after another so now all the construction thing is up in the air right now 'cause he knows he has done wrong
137,599.09,609.02,Participant,and uh but he doesn't wanna face the fact that well he knows it but he doesn't wanna really face the fact so he says look it's my project no it's our project
137,609.855,614.805,Participant,so uh eh that that's one of the biggest arguments what we're having right now um
137,615.35,616.99,Participant,that i can think of that's recent
137,617.637,619.177,Ellie,describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)
137,620.31,625.11,Participant,i felt that he <h> he <h> he didn't really listen to me
137,625.49,635.84,Participant,and he more so looked at uh a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways 'cause i told him that um
137,636.83,638.41,Participant,you need to do your research
137,638.73,646.33,Participant,i'm the type of person i do my research before i jump into something i i i try to dot my i's and cross my t's
137,646.685,653.18,Participant,but my husband he's not like that he's like oh i can get this person can do this project for x amount of money
137,653.735,657.895,Participant,and he's a good friend of mine so i don't care i mean is he licensed
137,658.39,663.19,Participant,he doesn't look at all that stuff he's he just jumps into it <laughter>
137,660.656,661.046,Ellie,right2 (right)
137,663.64,669.66,Participant,which cost him some extra money unnecessary money that he spent when and then i mean it was a lot of money
137,670.19,674.66,Participant,and so i was really very upset yesterday and i was very upset about it because
137,671.054,671.894,Ellie,that_sucks (that sucks)
137,675.15,680.7,Participant,it was just wasted money that we could've saved 'cause we wind up doing the same thing all over again
137,681.595,682.035,Ellie,yeah_downer (yeah)
137,681.735,683.255,Participant,and it didn't make any sense
137,685.315,689.094,Ellie,situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
137,690.63,691.2,Participant,um
137,694.29,695.37,Participant,i retired early
137,696.34,704.47,Participant,um i was very fortunate to retire at age fifty i retired in two thousand and two i was working for the state of california
137,705.28,713.46,Participant,um as a disability analyst and what happened was i was able the reason why i was able to retire so early because i'd been working since i was eighteen
137,714.12,716.83,Participant,and i had like thirty one and a half years of service
137,717.39,723.37,Participant,and what was so nice about it that only needed <n> needed to vest in like ten years in my health insurance
137,723.79,731.28,Participant,so i was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpirg and i don't know if you're familiar with calpirg but
137,731.81,737.27,Participant,um we we have a excellent retirement system and since i had been working with them so long
137,738.14,738.74,Participant,um
137,739.19,746.45,Participant,i didn't get the full percentage i should've stayed 'til i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i didn't get the full amount but that's okay
137,746.99,752.62,Participant,um eh i i found myself going back doing a little part-time job
137,753.04,758.54,Participant,because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis <laughter> so um
137,759.595,770.865,Participant,i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should've kinda waited 'til i was fifty five than fifty but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up
137,771.5,773.7,Participant,and i don't i pay very little money
137,774.04,780.45,Participant,so i think that over uh negates the uh uh uh the money that i receive

137,789.15,790.2,Participant,let me see the hardest
137,791.815,796.355,Participant,it's probably when my mom died 'cause uh i'm not used to anybody dying
137,797.005,798.635,Participant,and my mother um
137,799.23,802.83,Participant,died in ninety nine of uh non-hodgkin lymphoma

137,817.95,820.51,Participant,and i'm like oh my god what do i do xxx
137,821.15,829.85,Participant,and so um i was kinda like left out there trying to find her insurance policy 'cause i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order
137,830.42,837.52,Participant,and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things
137,837.95,845.21,Participant,you know i myself i keep my things organized but um for some unknown reason she didn't have hers organized and
137,845.75,851.345,Participant,i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay 'cause i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff
137,851.87,855.28,Participant,and unfortunately my mom <laughter> this is interesting
137,855.84,864.34,Participant,she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with with accident she had
137,864.705,870.505,Participant,a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything

147,120.05,123.6,Participant,um recently i went to honduras again that's where my family's from

147,129.25,135.47,Participant,so i do it by not imposing on them i visit them but i stay in a hotel so that way i can still kinda have my freedom
147,135.88,139.38,Participant,and not feel like i'm obligated to being with them so it's more fun that way

147,188.595,189.125,Participant,hmm
147,191.12,193.49,Participant,well i guess it would have to do with food i love to cook
147,193.96,199.22,Participant,and the only reason i hesitate is because i love to cook but i just do it for home and friends and family
147,199.58,207.95,Participant,if it were to turn into in if it were to turn into a job i feel as if it would just not be as joyous or i wouldn't have as much fun as i do have it you know as i have now
147,208.37,215.51,Participant,but if i could just do it as a job and still have the fun and the joy that i have in cooking every day now then that would be my dream job
147,216.146,216.616,Ellie,yeah3 (yeah)
147,218.601,223.011,Ellie,shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing)

147,235.34,242.86,Participant,uh depends on where i'm at if i'm wherever i'm at actually the first thing i do is just kinda get a hold of myself that way i'm always in control no matter where i'm standing at
147,243.21,246.88,Participant,and always say that i am my own peace p a p e a c e
147,247.25,250.6,Participant,so i just kinda just take a deep breath assess my situation
147,250.98,258.52,Participant,figure out what i can control what i can't control and then proceed from there but just sort of just kinda <deep breath> <sigh> breathe and get a hold of myself first
147,259.19,259.7,Ellie,mhm (mhm)
147,260.274,262.334,Ellie,control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
147,262.685,265.695,Participant,i'm actually very good i'm actually very mild-tempered to begin with
147,266.11,268.61,Participant,um i don't really let anything agitate me
147,269.03,273.29,Participant,and so if i do feel myself just getting hot or if i just react i just sort of just like i said i just
147,273.61,284.01,Participant,do my own little self check you know eh i might've cussed i might've went off for a second but i do my own little self check and just say you know what come on no this is mm it's not worth it this person's not worth it the situation is not worth it
147,284.4,286.1,Participant,be who you are and just stay there
147,287.858,290.908,Ellie,last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
147,290.73,300.66,Participant,actually it was with my husband and we were going back and forth about my relationship with my father and i was trying to get a point across to him and he was just kinda overlooking my feelings in it
147,301.03,308.11,Participant,and i was i didn't want him to overlook my feelings and act as if i wasn't feeling the way i was feeling so i kept stressing my point in different ways
147,308.425,317.065,Participant,and then i found myself now in a debate and then that's when i pulled back and said no look babe this is how i feel about it i'm not asking you to make me feel any differently i'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings
147,318.43,319.97,Ellie,describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)
147,320.26,323.49,Participant,when i got to my own conclusion i felt triumphant because
147,323.865,333.865,Participant,the point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how i felt not for him to impose his you know he's very a macho kinda manly guy i didn't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic
147,334.21,338.84,Participant,and so i said no as long as i i felt better because i he i felt undestood and i felt heard
147,340.224,340.694,Ellie,mm (mm)
147,341.911,345.7,Ellie,situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
147,346.4,348.55,Participant,hmm <sigh> let's see
147,349.28,351.96,Participant,i can my son comes to mind he's twenty two years old
147,352.47,357.1,Participant,and he we have a very estranged relationship right now and it's okay i'm okay with it
147,357.45,364.29,Participant,he's used to be being a little bit more needy so he i think he assumed that i would just always look xxx go looking for him or call for him
147,364.67,366.3,Participant,as opposed to waiting him to call me
147,366.77,367.26,Participant,and i think
147,367.94,377.03,Participant,it may be a very weird answer but i wish early on in my life as his mother i would've kind of adjusted that so that he wouldn't be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come
147,377.39,379.35,Participant,and check on him he doesn't live with me he has his own place
147,379.75,387.77,Participant,but waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and you know try to make sure that he's okay i think this is probably way more <laughter> ethereal than you meant but
147,388.215,396.96,Participant,i would've i would've done that differently i would've mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age meaning that i would've treated him more of an adult
147,397.355,399.735,Participant,and then also not expected him to just kinda you know
147,401.06,405.17,Participant,i would've killed the expectation in him for me to contour to him if that makes sense
147,404.751,405.221,Ellie,uh_huh (uh huh)
147,407.019,408.969,Ellie,easy_parent (do you find it easy to be a parent)
147,409.54,418.05,Participant,woo <laughter> no it's not easy you have to sacrifice and beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kid's needs ahead of your own and
147,418.96,424.84,Participant,i guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they're okay you're okay so
147,425.43,428.59,Participant,it my my son my daughter they both know i love them unconditionally
147,428.92,429.48,Participant,so
147,429.78,437.31,Participant,my parenting has become easier the more and more i've lived in that truth where i'm not expecting anything from them but then also not expecting any disrespect
147,437.735,443.405,Participant,so as long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect
147,443.937,444.577,Ellie,thats_good (that's good)
147,445.798,447.778,Ellie,parent_hardest (what's the hardest thing about being a parent)
147,448.64,456.28,Participant,seeing them maybe make decisions that i wish they wouldn't make uh it could be as simple as an outfit <laughter> you know choice or as much as a career change
147,456.63,461.12,Participant,but um having to sit back watch them listen be open and then just
147,461.48,468.36,Participant,kinda just be there you know if they wanna talk about it but then not also also trying not to manage them because i was also their age and i have to remember that
147,468.765,475.52,Participant,i i didn't wanna be managed and even if i made a mistake i didn't wanna be judged so the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on their own
147,475.88,479.74,Participant,and just sort of kinda just waiting around and luckily it's nothing major with my kids but
147,480.13,486.1,Participant,whatever that personal downfall is just kinda being there and not having an i told you i told you so um spirit on me
147,486.683,487.123,Ellie,yeah_downer (yeah)
147,488.247,489.967,Ellie,parent_best (what's the best thing about being a parent)
147,490.51,496.29,Participant,it's fulfilling knowing that you know i created this you know i planned both my kids so it's just it's a real
147,496.72,499.99,Participant,it's an honor that i was able to do it it's an honor that they're healthy
147,500.44,504.13,Participant,um and it's fun watching them sort of just kind of grow into their own
147,504.55,509.26,Participant,and it's like they're mini me's but then they're also different than i am and so it's fun just
147,509.72,515.38,Participant,being able to allow them uh be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so i'm enjoying that
147,517.156,520.992,Ellie,parent_differences (what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents)
147,521.01,527.24,Participant,wow completely my parents immigrated here from central america in the sixties um i was born the year after they got here
147,527.605,533.245,Participant,so their their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the american lifestyle eh which was not a bad thing
147,533.58,537.78,Participant,it's just that their parenting style was more about um making sure we had a home making sure
147,538.26,541.14,Participant,uh we had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling
147,541.5,547.86,Participant,but there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter or my father to me as a daughter
147,548.18,551.81,Participant,so i had to kinda figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent
147,554.829,558.429,Ellie,hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
147,558.68,565.69,Participant,divorcing my first husband um 'cause i was gonna be the one that toppled that whole situation um he was a good father just not a good husband to me
147,566.097,570.737,Participant,and after twenty years i knew that i was gonna be the one to say this is not working for me anymore
147,571.13,571.62,Participant,and
147,571.92,583.02,Participant,since i did that the domino effect has <ha> was is this is not virtual it happened <laughter> we ended up selling our house you know dividing up the assets and then living separately and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while
147,583.51,588.17,Participant,um and then i just made some decisions to where i didn't wanna go through so much court hassle so i just
147,588.595,593.935,Participant,did a tina turner and said just give me my name you keep everything else so it was just a very hard decision by way of
147,594.3,597.58,Participant,how it affected my kids that's all i cared about in terms of losing everything
147,598.0,601.13,Participant,physical and and all the material stuff i could care less
147,601.5,605.81,Participant,but it was hard because i i knew it was gonna affect my kids and they were the only thing i was concerned about
147,606.557,607.987,Ellie,change_directions (what made you decide to do that)
147,608.7,620.13,Participant,uh my husband and i did not you know see eye to eye on certain things xxx regarding our marriage he i didn't feel validated as a woman or as a wife and that's just who i am and those were the very areas that
147,620.6,630.41,Participant,he didn't validate me in he just kinda saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extracurriculars whether it was just travel or or whatever the case may be i'm not i'm not here to talk about that part of it
147,631.31,635.37,Participant,bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of you know the sanctity of our home
147,635.75,647.06,Participant,and i was tired of just you know working and and and him benefiting from everything but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife and he wasn't prepared to change xxx despite all the counseling we went through
147,647.5,657.23,Participant,and i thought well this is not working for me and i have to take care of myself first and i i had low self-esteem i you know i wasn't perfect i had a lot of things going on with myself and i had to learn how to love myself
147,657.57,662.97,Participant,in order to uh in order for me to love my children and then in order for me to get the love that i should get in return
147,664.729,665.129,Ellie,downer (okay)

147,689.86,694.81,Participant,did i not do you know and i'm not being sanctimonious or acting as if i'm pollyanna but i believe in karma
147,695.14,698.89,Participant,i'm a god-fearing woman so i just wanna make sure that i did everything i was supposed to do today
147,699.285,703.255,Participant,and if there's something that i can rectify you know i just make it a point to promise to myself to
147,703.62,707.94,Participant,go back and rectify it or at least learn from that and just not make that same mistake in another day

147,784.15,787.42,Participant,without really saying anything i really felt her just accepting herself
147,787.84,791.23,Participant,and she accepted the fact that i accept who she is as she is so it was a very
147,791.94,797.83,Participant,tame moment only she and i kinda knew about it but it just it gave just a happiness that nothing else could ever give me

147,895.63,899.57,Participant,so i can't you know very well take the benefit from it and then turn around and call it a regret
147,900.13,905.32,Participant,because i know i learned from it um probably sounds very textbook but that's true that's just really how i live so i believe that
147,905.74,911.95,Participant,everything good bad ugly or indifferent happened for a reason i truly believe that and my job is to take from it

174,1015.11,1021.26,Participant,one day she was really upset about something um because a board member had called her up and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer
174,1021.82,1025.09,Participant,um and he was upset about something and
174,1025.55,1032.61,Participant,it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was
174,1033.14,1033.56,Participant,um
174,1034.53,1038.99,Participant,but it wasn't i i've been a manager for many years um and i

174,1055.74,1059.71,Participant,um you know incompetent or at least that's the the way that i felt about it
174,1060.24,1061.36,Participant,and um
174,1062.45,1063.39,Participant,i did you know
174,1063.79,1065.32,Participant,i tried to be very calm and

174,1070.38,1075.1,Participant,uh after that our relationship wasn't really the same and i ended up staying <st> uh leaving there
174,1075.59,1082.45,Participant,to go back to the old organization that i'd worked for not that long afterwards because i just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me
174,1082.83,1084.51,Participant,or after we had that interaction so

174,1104.85,1105.59,Participant,which is
174,1106.11,1109.09,Participant,um when you think about buying something instead of thinking

174,1115.89,1119.35,Participant,it uh don't think of it as costing a hundred dollars think of it as costing ten times that
174,1119.75,1125.49,Participant,because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it
174,1126.12,1126.4,Participant,you know
174,1126.93,1130.83,Participant,intelligently um you would have ten times that much money eventually so
174,1131.24,1137.77,Participant,you should really think about it in those terms and um i think i've been much more a consumer than a saver and so i wish that i had uh
174,1138.64,1140.7,Participant,been more aware of that ten or twenty years ago

179,545.4,546.29,Participant,the i guess the
179,546.69,553.59,Participant,anger was probably the secondary response but my initial response was that um i felt <f> was feeling attacked and that came out as anger
179,552.702,553.172,Ellie,mm (mm)
179,554.27,554.87,Participant,so
179,555.44,556.55,Participant,i would think um

179,593.93,594.25,Participant,i
179,595.48,598.62,Participant,i i just felt very strongly that that was something that we should pursue
179,599.26,599.83,Participant,and
179,600.71,606.74,Participant,but at the same time i knew that if if my wife wasn't supportive of it that it it would it would kinda fall apart
179,607.26,607.77,Participant,so
179,608.61,610.47,Participant,i kinda relinquished <r> relinquished it

179,626.61,631.79,Participant,you know again that that that kinda felt like a loss 'cause i felt deeply that that's what i was supposed to do
179,632.38,632.85,Participant,um
179,633.48,635.74,Participant,but then after i kinda gave that up

179,637.24,637.53,Participant,um
179,638.08,642.83,Participant,then she came to a point where she said no i have a peace about about doing this and then we went ahead and pursued it so
