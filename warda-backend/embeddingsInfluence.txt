I'm here for you, and I want you to know that it's completely normal to feel worried about your mental health. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge your concerns and seek help.

Anxiety is a common condition that affects many people, and it's not something to be ashamed of. It's like having a constant companion that can be overwhelming at times, but with the right tools and support, you can learn to manage it.

Some common symptoms of anxiety include:

* Feeling restless, on edge, or tense
* Difficulty concentrating or making decisions
* Irritability or mood swings
* Feeling overwhelmed or like you're going to lose control
* Difficulty sleeping or insomnia
* Physical symptoms like a racing heart, sweating, or trembling
* Avoiding certain situations or activities due to fear or worry

But here's the thing: everyone experiences anxiety differently, and it's not just about the symptoms. It's about how it affects your daily life and relationships. Do you find yourself avoiding certain situations or people because of anxiety? Are there certain triggers that set you off? Do you feel like you're constantly worrying about something, even when there's no apparent reason?

Remember, I'm here to listen and support you. We can work together to explore your concerns and develop strategies to help you cope with anxiety. And if you need additional help, I can remind you that there are many resources available, such as therapists, support groups, and online resources.

You're not alone in this, and I'm here to help you feel more grounded and supported. How are you feeling right now, and what do you think might be contributing to your worries about anxiety?

=== Response WITH Context ===
I'm so glad you reached out and shared your concerns with me. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and express worries about our mental health. I'm here to listen and support you.

Firstly, please know that it's completely normal to feel worried or uncertain about your mental health. Anxiety is a common experience that many people face. It's not a sign of weakness, and it doesn't mean you're flawed or broken. It simply means you're human, and you're trying to navigate a complex world.

Now, regarding your question about symptoms of anxiety, there are many signs that can indicate anxiety is affecting you. Some common symptoms include:

* Feeling restless, on edge, or irritable
* Having difficulty concentrating or making decisions
* Experiencing muscle tension, headaches, or stomachaches
* Worrying excessively about everyday things
* Having trouble sleeping or experiencing insomnia
* Feeling like you're constantly "on the go" or "wound up"
* Avoiding activities or situations because they make you feel anxious

Keep in mind that everyone experiences anxiety differently, and you might not exhibit all of these symptoms. The important thing is to recognize how you feel and acknowledge your emotions.

As we explore this further, I want to reassure you that you're not alone in this. Many people have successfully managed their anxiety and learned to live fulfilling lives. We can work together to identify coping strategies and resources that might help you feel more grounded and in control.

Before we proceed, I want to check in with you. How are you feeling right now? Is there anything specific that's been causing you to worry about anxiety?
